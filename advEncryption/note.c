//The first program prompts the user to enter the filename of the file to be encrypted and the encryption key.
// It then opens the input file for reading, creates a new file with the encrypted extension,
//and reads each byte from the input file, encrypts it using the provided key, and writes it to the output file. 
//The program uses a simple modulo operation to wrap around the character values and prevent them from exceeding the valid range.
